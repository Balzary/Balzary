## Hi! I'm Guilherme Travassos ‚úåÔ∏è

### Mobile Developer (Android and iOS) ###

I am an Android developer passionate about creating innovative and impactful solutions for millions of users. I graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from the Paulista College of Informatics and Administration (FIAP) in 2019 and am currently seeking an opportunity to return to the field I love.

### Achievements ###
I participated in Digital Experience, a project conducted by IBM in partnership with FIAP, where I achieved a placement among the top 10 at FIAP. I also took part in the Smart Cities Challenge, another applied project, this time by Oracle in partnership with FIAP, where my team and I secured second place.
